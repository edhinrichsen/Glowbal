## Getting Started

### Local Installation

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running for development and testing. This project runs on an Express backend and React frontend with TypeScript. You will need `npm` and `yarn` installed to start.

#### API Server: Express

First start by installing and running the Express backend in the `api` directory.

In the root directory, start by installing the dependent node modules:

```
cd api
npm install
```

To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can run the server with hot loading with `nodemon`

```
nodemon
```

#### Client: React

First start by installing and running the React frontend in the `client` directory.

```
cd client
yarn add
```

In the `client` directory, you can start the React app by running:

```
yarn start
```

Once you are done, the app should automatically launch, however, the app can be found at:

```
localhost:3000
```
